## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Pedro BrandÃ£o. I am currently studying Electrotechnical Engineering and Computer Science at ISEP.

I am starting to learn Computer Science (especially C, JAVA, and LISP for AutoCAD for my current job).

I'm eager to learn so I can develop my career in Computer Science and start contributing to open-source projects.

PS. Not an emoji fan
